## Story description

## Implementation

### Flow

* User creates playlist
* Adds title
* Adds description (not output initially)
* Adds items

### Harvester

* Get list of users
* Get 'lightboxes' for all users? (could just be one user to start with)
* Gets list of assets in the response
* Create an object in Harvester indexed by playlist id with a list of asset_ids of all items in correct order

### Elasticsearch

* Playlists are ordered lists. Therefore the system will need to handle keeping items ordered throughout the pipeline.
* This could be handled in Elasticsearch using nested documents on the
     video documents.
* This would allow a one to many relationship to be tracked.
* Also add a simple multi-valued field on doc to allow for easy aggs and filtering

### Example documents in Elasticsearch

Update mapping with properties:

``` json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "playlists": {
          "type": "nested",
          "properties": {
            "id": {
              "type": "keyword"
            },
            "name": {
              "type": "keyword"
            },
            "position": {
              "type": "integer"
            }
          }
        },
    }
  }
}
```

Example document:

``` json
{
  "title" : "My video",
 "video_url": "https://location.com/my-video",
  "playlists" : [
    {
      "id": "12",
      "name" : "Featured",
      "position" : 1
    },
    {
      "id": "10",
      "name" : "Cool videos",
      "position" : 4
    }
  ]
}
```

Example query to get playlist information:

```
GET video_nested/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "playlists": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "playlists"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "by_playlist": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "playlists.id",
      "size": 1,
          }
          , "aggs": {
            "playlist_videos": {
              "top_hits": {
                "size": 10,
                "_source": ["playlists.name","playlists.position"],
                "sort": [{
                  "playlists.position": {
                    "order": "asc"
                  }
                }]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
